# Hey there! 👋 I'm mochensky

I'm a passionate programmer who loves to dive into different technologies and build things that make the digital world more interesting (and occasionally break it in the process 😅).

### What do I do? 🤔

Well, where do I even begin? I guess you could say I'm a bit of a code chameleon (💀), fluent in multiple languages but not fully married to any single one. Here's what I've dabbled in:

- **Python** – My go-to for everything from automation scripts to AI experiments.
- **JavaScript** – The magic behind those shiny interactive websites (or sometimes buggy ones… 😅).
- **Java** – Because sometimes you need something a little more robust.
- **Lua** – For scripting in games (hello Roblox!).
- **C# & C++** – Not my everyday tools, but I've dipped my toes in. Pretty cool when I need some power, like when working on Unity or handling some serious performance stuff.

### What projects have I worked on? 🚀

- **Frontend Websites** – Mostly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've created everything from simple landing pages to more complex single-page apps.
- **Discord Bots** – Because who doesn't love customizing their server? (Send me a DM if you need a fun bot for your Discord channel.)
- **Telegram Bots** – Similar to Discord bots, but for Telegram. I like to make things that make your life easier (or at least more fun).
- **Minecraft Mods and Plugins** – Yes, I've made mods. Yes, I've created plugins. Yes, I've had way too much fun on Minecraft servers. (Who hasn't tried to create their own Minecraft server, right? ⛏)
- **Minecraft Servers** – I’ve set up some Minecraft servers for friends.
- **Random Little Projects** – Because sometimes the best ideas come when you least expect them. They may not all be "big," but hey, they were fun!

### My Approach 💡

I don't have a favorite programming language (I just can’t commit 🙄). I’m always eager to learn something new and tackle challenges head-on. If it involves code, I’m in. Whether it's solving a tricky bug, building a fun little bot, or experimenting with a new framework—if I haven’t tried it yet, I’m excited to give it a shot.

In the end, it's all about learning, experimenting, and creating things that I can be proud of... or at least have fun with along the way. 🎉
